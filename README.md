## What is this?

Terraform code, for building projects; mostly in AWS.

## What is it for?

Mainly practice for myself and learning how to use more advanced features.

## Who can use it?

Anyone who wants to. I make no promises for its capabilities. Use at your own risk

## Usage

Mostly these are examples. I am not Gruntworks and this repo doesn't pretend
to be examples of best practices. That being said, a focus is made on readabilty
and clarity. Comments are made where appropriate and functionality is broken up
and decoupled. Not everything needs to live in main.tf!
