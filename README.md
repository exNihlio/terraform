## What is this?

Terraform code, for building projects in AWS.

## What is it for?

Mainly practice for myself and learning how to use more advanced features.

## Who can use it?

Anyone who wants to. I make no promises for its capabilities. Use at your own risk

## Usage

The LXD branch was written to provision systems in AWS for testing and running LXD. 
I have since merged this back in master. Things will be a bit backwards here.
Master is the workspace for new code, and then once that code is complete, it will
be checked out into a separate branch. Future development of that code will take place
in that branch.

This is because there will be Terraform code for a LOT of projects here, and they can't
all live in the same space. So, if you want to learn how to provision EC2 instances, 
check out the EC2 branch, when it exists.
